# External GPS File

Some people in the community are  using separate .gpx files for GPS data.

The information below is from community member
Toyo Fujita and is an example of a manual workflow that
could be automated.

Some tests tell us 8K 2/10fps video of THETA X would be the best solution for using Streetview Studio. However, the image quality is far from satisfactory [in Toyo's opinion].

I think 7.3K THETA Z1 Blue line is awesome. The workflow is more complicated than that of X.

1. Connect Z1 with Theta Basic app iOS/Android.
2. Shoot Single DNG images.
3. Selected Mode is ISO Priority. Handheld HDR is no good.
4. Develop in Lightroom Classic one by one and batch stitching in RTS.
5. Export JPGs and remove the ugly shooter.
6. Drop them onto JPG2VID
7. Upload .mp4 and .gpx files from Streetview Studio
8. Proccessingâ€¦ takes 24-48hours to complete.
