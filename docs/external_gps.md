# External GPS File

Shows people are already using separate .gpx file for GPS data

Other tests tell us 8K 2/10fps video of Theta X would be the best solution for using Streetview Studio. However, the image quality is far from satisfactory.

I think 7.3K(Theta Z1) Blue line is awesome. The workflow is more complicated a bit than that of X.

1. Connect Z1 with Theta Basic app iOS/Android.
2. Shoot Single DNG images.
3. Selected Mode is ISO Priority. Handheld HDR is no good.
4. Develop in Lightroom Classic one by one and batch stitching in RTS.
5. Export JPGs and remove the ugly shooter.
6. Drop them onto JPG2VID
7. Upload .mp4 and .gpx files from Streetview Studio
8. Proccessingâ€¦ takes 24-48hours to complete.
