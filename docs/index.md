# RICOH THETA IMU and GNSS Sensors

![banner](images/home/banner.png)

RICOH THETA cameras are widely used to document the condition
of streets,  buildings, trails, power lines, construction
sites and other types of infrastructure. THETA 360¬∞ images
are used in virtual tours or overlayed onto maps.

Excellent image quality, low cost, and ease-of-use make RICOH
THETA cameras an excellent choice for projects requiring
visual documentation of large areas.  

In addition to taking single and interval images, people also
use video frame extraction to easily take thousands of images.

RICOH THETA cameras are started be used in Geographic
Information Systems (GIS)[^1] Although technologies like LiDAR and GPS
Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) provide superior accuracy, the RICOH THETA
X and Z1 can be used to supplement these data sources. RICOH THETA
cameras are quick to setup, cheaper than traditional GIS equipment
and may be good enough for some applications.

## Video Frame Extraction Example

In the example below, 8K 360¬∞ video is taken at 10fps by simply walking
around with the camera held overhead. The individual frames
are automatically placed on a map using the internal GPS data,
compass, and orientation sensor data.

## Process to Attach GNSS Data to 360¬∞ Images

| Shooting Method | Where GNSS Data is Saved | How GNSS Data is Recorded |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Z1  single or interval shooting of indoor / outdoor still images on map | metadata in [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) format  Easy to extract | THETA WebAPI accepts GPS data |
| X single or interval shooting | metadata in Exif format | X internal GNSS technology can write metadata inside of camera.  Alternately, the same API as the Z1 can be used to write coordinates |
| 8K video frame extraction | Data is stored in a separate [CaMM](https://developers.google.com/streetview/publish/camm-spec) track and needs to be matched | X has 8K low fps video with onboard GPS and IMU stored in video metadata |

## Hot Tip üå∂Ô∏è

RICOH THETA cameras include an internal compass that will record the camera orientation. However, if the compass requires calibration, compass information such as PoseHeadingDegrees and GPSImgDirection will not be recorded.

There is an easy fix. Jump to the [Compass and Orientation](compass_orientation.md) section to get more information and see videos how you can easily recalibrate the compass for both Z1 and X.

Please note, a warning icon _should_ show on the LCD for both the Z1 and the X. But only if your firmware is up-to-date. THETA X needs to be 2.40.0 or later ([more information](https://community.theta360.guide/t/theta-x-firmware-updated-to-2-40-0-new-compass-error-icon-and-tips-for-how-to-calibrate-compass-handheld-hdr/9468)). RICOH always strongly recommends updating to the latest firmware version.
