# Sensor Data in Image Metadata

![sensor metadata](images/sensor_image/sensor_metadata.png)

For still images, sensor data is stored in the metadata of the image

Cameras have the following internal sensors:

* accelerometer
* gyroscope
* electronic compass

In addition, the THETA X has internal GPS
The data is written into the image metadata and can be read and written with a number of free tools, including [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/).
